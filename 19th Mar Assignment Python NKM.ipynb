    "\n",
    "Here is an example to illustrate when up-sampling and down-sampling might be required:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset of credit card fraud detection, where the target variable has two classes: \"fraud\" and \"not fraud\". The dataset contains 1,000 instances, out of which only 10 instances are labeled as \"fraud\". In this case, the data is highly imbalanced, and the minority class (fraud) is crucial to identify.\n",

    "To handle the imbalance, we can up-sample the minority class to create more instances of \"fraud\". For example, we can use SMOTE to create 100 new instances of \"fraud\" by synthesizing them from the existing instances. Now, we have a balanced dataset with 110 instances of each class.\n",

    "Alternatively, we can down-sample the majority class to reduce the number of instances of \"not fraud\".

    "One-class SVM: This technique involves training a support vector machine (SVM) on the minority class samples to identify the support vectors. These support vectors are then used to create synthetic samples for the minority class. This can help to increase the size of the minority class and balance the dataset.\n",

    "It is important to note that up-sampling the minority class can result in overfitting, especially if the minority class is already small. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the performance of the model on both the original and balanced datasets to determine the effectiveness of the up-sampling technique. Additionally, using validation techniques such as cross-validation and regularization can help to prevent overfitting."
